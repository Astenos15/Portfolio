<h3>How To Make It</h3>
<h3>Step 1</h3>
In a large, shallow dish, combine the 1/4 cup of olive oil with the thyme, minced garlic, rosemary and cumin. Add the lamb chops and turn to coat with the marinade. Refrigerate overnight.

<h3>Step 2</h3>
Preheat the oven to 350Â°. Set the halved heads of garlic cut side up on a large sheet of foil and drizzle with oil. Wrap the garlic in the foil and roast for 1 hour, until tender.

<h3>Step3</h3>
Light a grill. Remove the chops from the marinade; discard the thyme and scrape off the garlic. Season the chops with salt and pepper and grill over moderate heat until lightly charred and medium-rare, 5 minutes per side. Serve the chops with the roasted garlic and White Bean Puree.
